        <!-- <h1 class="h-primary center ">Our Vission</h1> -->
        <p id="Vissionp">Our approach to the wealth management services is to assist you in managing your wealth in efficent and effective manner with your mandate as the guiding framework taking your risk and expectations into consideration. We define your asset allocation
            and individual asset portfolios based on the requirements and mandate given by you. This mandate is technically discussed in detail with you before a specific recommendation is made. As a result, it is a very niche tool for managing wealth
            and not a mass product. Each client could have different portfolio requirements and hence a different portfolio and asset allocation.
        </p>
        <p id="Vissionp">OWe understand the client's risk profile and his needs in terms of liquidity, capital appreciation, income requirements, etc and after a detailed discussion with his overall psyche/personality, we determine the asset allocation and individual
            asset portfolios. We have a online subscription plan where we offers our client various offers regarding portfolio management,

        <h1 class="Vissionhead ">Why better</h1>
        <!-- <h1 class="h-primary center ">Our Vission</h1> -->
        <p id="Vissionp">We believe, this model renders itself to superior expectations matching resulting in enhanced client delight. The client is in direct knowledge of the portfolio construction and understands the overall level of risk and expected returns. Basically
            this process reduces the surprise element due to detailed asset allocation, diversification and expectations management. We work with a fair amount of cushion to reduce the negative surprise element in the portfolio returns.

        <h1 class="Vissionhead ">Process-Back to Basics/Discipline is the key</h1>
        <!-- <h1 class="h-primary center ">Our Vission</h1> -->
        <p id="Vissionp">The process is extremely simple. The asset allocation is decided based on the risk and return. </p>
        <p id="Vissionp">We follow rigorous discipline in investing and are risk averse investors. We are typically less diversified(as per the general understanding).We build portfolios based on this approach and are extremely conscious of the capital protection and
            cost of capital concepts. </p>
        <p id="Vissionp">Basic concepts of valuations and market cycles are inherent in our approach. Long term (5 year/10 year) valuation averages are a guiding pillar. Market swings of pessimism and optimism or the basic volatility help us create portfolios from a medium
            to long term perspective. </p>

        <!-- <h1 class="h-primary center ">Our Vission</h1> -->
        <p id="Vissionp">We undertake complete asset allocation assignments or individual asset portfolios. For example, we could advise a client on his entire wealth and its management based on his requirement over a period of time. Or we could advise a client on his
            real estate or equity portfolios. </p>
        <p id="Vissionp">We employ the best of breed approach for the various asset allocation decisions. The various investible assets that one could evaluate could be the likes of Local Equities(direct and Mutual Fund), International Equities(direct and Mutual Funds),
            Fixed Income(Direct and Mutual Funds), Real Estate(Direct- Residential, Commercial, Plots, etc and REITs), Commodities, etc. </p>
